**Speech-to-Text Translator with Speech Recognition and Google Translate**

**Overview**

This project provides a real-time speech-to-text translator that converts spoken words in languages like Gujarati and Hindi into English. It leverages Python's speech_recognition library for capturing and transcribing speech, and googletrans for translating the transcribed text into the desired language.

**Features**

Real-Time Speech Recognition: Captures spoken words using the microphone and converts them into text.

Multilingual Support: Supports speech recognition in multiple languages, including Gujarati and Hindi.

Instant Translation: Automatically translates recognized speech into English using Google Translate.

Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for cases where speech is not recognized.

**Prerequisites**
-Python 3.x installed on your system.

-Required Python packages: speech_recognition, googletrans.

**Installation**

Clone the Repository:

git clone url

Install Required Python Packages:

-pip install speechrecognition googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 pyaudio

Note: You may need to install PyAudio separately, depending on your system. For Windows:

-pip install pipwin

-pipwin install pyaudio

Usage

Run the Script:

-python main.py

Speak into the Microphone:

The script will prompt you to speak. It will capture your speech and display the recognized text in the specified language (e.g., Gujarati or Hindi).

The recognized text will then be translated into English and displayed.

Supported Languages:

Modify the script to change the source language (src) in the translate() method if you want to support additional languages.

**Customization**

Source and Destination Languages: You can easily customize the source (src) and destination (dest) languages in the translation part of the code to support other language pairs.

Error Handling: Modify the try-except blocks to provide more detailed error messages or to handle specific types of exceptions.
